# Mod the Game: Python Arcade Remix (Team Project) 

In this project, your team will choose any open-source Python game and make small, observable changes to it. These changes can affect visuals, gameplay, or structure. You’ll work together to decide what to change, who will do what, and how to document your work just like a software development team in the field. 

## Team Structure & Flexibility 

Your team will meet to choose a game, explore the code, and decide what changes to make. You will also assign roles: Team Lead, Developer 1, and Developer 2. Teams may swap tasks or sub-tasks if everyone agrees. 

### Suggested Roles: 

- **Team Lead**: Sets up the game, confirms it runs, helps locate code sections, makes a small refactor or adds documentation, and submits the final project. 

- **Developer 1**: Makes one visual change (e.g., background color, sprite image) and documents the change. 

- **Developer 2**: Makes one gameplay change (e.g., speed, scoring) and documents the change. 

## Learning Outcomes 

### Students will: 
- Navigate and understand an existing Python codebase 
- Make small, observable changes to code and assets 
- Collaborate using real-world team dynamics 
- Document and explain their changes 

## Project Timeline (10 Class Days) 

    Day 1–2: __________ Team meeting: choose game, assign roles, plan changes 

    Day 3–5: __________  Each member explores and modifies their part 

    Day 6: __________  Standup meeting to share progress 

    Day 7–8: __________  Test and integrate changes 

    Day 9: __________  Polish code and write README 

    Day 10: __________  Submit final project and reflections 

    Finals Day: Presentations/Demos (In Class) 

## Technical Requirements 

### Your project must include: 

    - One visual change 

    - One gameplay change 

    - One small refactor or comment block 

    - A README describing what was changed 

    - Inline comments explaining each change 

### Stretch Goals (Optional) 

    - Add a sound effect 

    - Change the game title or splash screen 

    - Add a simple new rule (e.g., bonus points) 

    - Package the game for sharing 

## In-Class Presentation and Demonstration 

Each team will give a brief in-class presentation (maximum 5 minutes) to demonstrate their modified game and explain their changes. 

### Presentation Date: __________ 

### Example of how to distribute your team's presentation tasks: 

    - Team Lead: Introduce the project and the game you chose 

    - Developer 1: Describe the visual change and show it in action 

    - Developer 2: Describe the gameplay change and show it in action 

### Presentation Tips 

    - Practice your timing to stay within the 5-minute limit 

    - Make sure your game runs smoothly on the presentation computer 

    - Speak clearly and explain your changes in simple terms 

    - Show before-and-after effects if possible 

    - Be ready to answer questions from the class or instructor
